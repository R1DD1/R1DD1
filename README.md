<h2>Java</h2>
I have been studying this language for more than 2 years. I have excellent knowledge of Bukkit, a good understanding of packages and nms, OOP and its principles and patterns. 

<h2>Kotlin</h2>
I have been studying this language for more than 1 years. Kotlin programming skills are at the same level as Java, their similarity helped me quickly get used to this language and perform various projects (PC applications, creating plugins on the Bukkit API)
